# What is Docker??

```
Docker is an open source tool/product used for OS virtualization
-> Containerization
-> Platform as a Service product
```

Problem it solves:

* Sandboxed isolated environment -> Secure
* Portable

**Note:** Containers are platform independent and are guaranteed to run on any system/environment irrespective of the configurations given that Containerization Engine exists on them.

* Distributed Development with mirroring
* Lightweight: Does not need its own OS.
